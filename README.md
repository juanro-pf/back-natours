# NATOURS APP

Hi! Please check the deployed project at https://natours-jro.herokuapp.com/, I developed this project using Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose for the backend and Pug for the frontend.

There are some issues with the frontend, please install chrome extension "Disable Content-Security-Policy" offered by *Phil Grayson*, activating this extension in the website will solve them. I will do the frontend with React.js in the future (not soon, as currently I am working in other projects) so the frontend works with no issues.

Check the API documentation in here https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13084178/TVYPztQp#7b80d702-110e-4c12-ad80-cb8740912d27.

Sign up functionality is not implemented in the frontend, so please login using any existing user (monica@example.com, for example), the password for all of the users is "test1234".
